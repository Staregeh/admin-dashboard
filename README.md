# Admin Dashboard

## Overview

Admin dashboard, which represents overview of dashboard of the modern website. Project uses **MERN(MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS)** stack. Created along with youtube tutorial to sharpen my skills, and to explore something new, like Nivo charts.<br /> 
**Note that since I am using Render's free tier, so it turns off after it was not used for 15 minutes. Please be patient and give server some time to load for the first time.** <br />
